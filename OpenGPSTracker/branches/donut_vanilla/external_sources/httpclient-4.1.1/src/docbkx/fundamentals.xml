        <title>Request execution</title>
        <para> The most essential function of HttpClient is to execute HTTP methods. Execution of an
            HTTP method involves one or several HTTP request / HTTP response exchanges, usually
            handled internally by HttpClient. The user is expected to provide a request object to
            execute and HttpClient is expected to transmit the request to the target server return a
            corresponding response object, or throw an exception if execution was unsuccessful. </para>
        <para> Quite naturally, the main entry point of the HttpClient API is the HttpClient
            interface that defines the contract described above. </para>
        <para>Here is an example of request execution process in its simplest form:</para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet("http://localhost/");
HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httpget);
HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();
if (entity != null) {
    InputStream instream = entity.getContent();
    int l;
    byte[] tmp = new byte[2048];
    while ((l = instream.read(tmp)) != -1) {
    }
}

        <section>
            <title>HTTP request</title>
            <para>All HTTP requests have a request line consisting a method name, a request URI and
                an HTTP protocol version.</para>
            <para>HttpClient supports out of the box all HTTP methods defined in the HTTP/1.1
                specification: <literal>GET</literal>, <literal>HEAD</literal>,
                    <literal>POST</literal>, <literal>PUT</literal>, <literal>DELETE</literal>,
                    <literal>TRACE</literal> and <literal>OPTIONS</literal>. There is a specific
                class for each method type.: <classname>HttpGet</classname>,
                    <classname>HttpHead</classname>, <classname>HttpPost</classname>,
                    <classname>HttpPut</classname>, <classname>HttpDelete</classname>,
                    <classname>HttpTrace</classname>, and <classname>HttpOptions</classname>.</para>
            <para>The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier that identifies the resource upon
                which to apply the request. HTTP request URIs consist of a protocol scheme, host
                name, optional port, resource path, optional query, and optional fragment.</para>

            <title>HTTP entity</title>
            <para>HTTP messages can carry a content entity associated with the request or response.
                Entities can be found in some requests and in some responses, as they are optional.
                Requests that use entities are referred to as entity enclosing requests. The HTTP
                specification defines two entity enclosing request methods: <literal>POST</literal> and
                    <literal>PUT</literal>. Responses are usually expected to enclose a content
                entity. There are exceptions to this rule such as responses to
                    <literal>HEAD</literal> method and <literal>204 No Content</literal>,
                    <literal>304 Not Modified</literal>, <literal>205 Reset Content</literal>
                responses.</para>
            <para>HttpClient distinguishes three kinds of entities, depending on where their content
                originates:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <formalpara>
                        <title>streamed:</title>
                        <para>The content is received from a stream, or generated on the fly. In
                            particular, this category includes entities being received from HTTP
                            responses. Streamed entities are generally not repeatable.</para>
                    </formalpara>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <formalpara>
                        <title>self-contained:</title>
                        <para>The content is in memory or obtained by means that are independent
                            from a connection or other entity. Self-contained entities are generally
                            repeatable. This type of entities will be mostly used for entity
                            enclosing HTTP requests.</para>
                    </formalpara>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <formalpara>
                        <title>wrapping:</title>
                        <para>The content is obtained from another entity.</para>
                    </formalpara>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <para>This distinction is important for connection management when streaming out content
                from an HTTP response. For request entities that are created by an application and
                only sent using HttpClient, the difference between streamed and self-contained is of
                little importance. In that case, it is suggested to consider non-repeatable entities
                as streamed, and those that are repeatable as self-contained.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Repeatable entities</title>
                <para>An entity can be repeatable, meaning its content can be read more than once.
                    This is only possible with self contained entities (like
                        <classname>ByteArrayEntity</classname> or
                        <classname>StringEntity</classname>)</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Using HTTP entities</title>
                <para>Since an entity can represent both binary and character content, it has
                    support for character encodings (to support the latter, ie. character
                    content).</para>
                <para>The entity is created when executing a request with enclosed content or when
                    the request was successful and the response body is used to send the result back
                    to the client.</para>
                <para>To read the content from the entity, one can either retrieve the input stream
                    via the <methodname>HttpEntity#getContent()</methodname> method, which returns
                    an <classname>java.io.InputStream</classname>, or one can supply an output
                    stream to the <methodname>HttpEntity#writeTo(OutputStream)</methodname> method,
                    which will return once all content has been written to the given stream.</para>
                <para>When the entity has been received with an incoming message, the methods
                        <methodname>HttpEntity#getContentType()</methodname> and
                        <methodname>HttpEntity#getContentLength()</methodname> methods can be used
                    for reading the common metadata such as <literal>Content-Type</literal> and
                        <literal>Content-Length</literal> headers (if they are available). Since the
                        <literal>Content-Type</literal> header can contain a character encoding for
                    text mime-types like text/plain or text/html, the
                        <methodname>HttpEntity#getContentEncoding()</methodname> method is used to
                    read this information. If the headers aren't available, a length of -1 will be
                    returned, and NULL for the content type. If the <literal>Content-Type</literal>
                    header is available, a <interfacename>Header</interfacename> object will be
                    returned.</para>
                <para>When creating an entity for a outgoing message, this meta data has to be
                    supplied by the creator of the entity.</para>

            <title>Ensuring release of low level resources</title>
            <para> In order to ensure proper release of system resources one must close the content
                stream associated with the entity.</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
HttpResponse response;
HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();

}
]]></programlisting>
            <para>Please note that the <methodname>HttpEntity#writeTo(OutputStream)</methodname> 
                method is also required to ensure proper release of system resources once the 
                entity has been fully written out. If this method obtains an instance of 
                <classname>java.io.InputStream</classname> by calling 
                <methodname>HttpEntity#getContent()</methodname>, it is also expected to close
                the stream in a finally clause.</para>
            <para>When working with streaming entities, one can use the
                <methodname>EntityUtils#consume(HttpEntity)</methodname> method to ensure that
                the entity content has been fully consumed and the underlying stream has been
                closed.</para>
            <para>There can be situations, however, when only a small portion of the entire response
                content needs to be retrieved and the performance penalty for consuming the
                remaining content and making the connection reusable is too high, in which case
                one can simply
                terminate the request by calling <methodname>HttpUriRequest#abort()</methodname>
                method.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Consuming entity content</title>
            <para>The recommended way to consume the content of an entity is by using its
                    <methodname>HttpEntity#getContent()</methodname> or
                    <methodname>HttpEntity#writeTo(OutputStream)</methodname> methods. HttpClient
                also comes with the <classname>EntityUtils</classname> class, which exposes several
                static methods to more easily read the content or information from an entity.
                Instead of reading the <classname>java.io.InputStream</classname> directly, one can
                retrieve the whole content body in a string / byte array by using the methods from
                this class. However, the use of <classname>EntityUtils</classname> is
                strongly discouraged unless the response entities originate from a trusted HTTP
                server and are known to be of limited length.</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet("http://localhost/");

}
]]></programlisting>
            <para>In some situations it may be necessary to be able to read entity content more than
                once. In this case entity content must be buffered in some way, either in memory or
                on disk. The simplest way to accomplish that is by wrapping the original entity with
                the <classname>BufferedHttpEntity</classname> class. This will cause the content of
                the original entity to be read into a in-memory buffer. In all other ways the entity
                wrapper will be have the original one.</para>

            <title>Producing entity content</title>
            <para>HttpClient provides several classes that can be used to efficiently stream out
                content though HTTP connections. Instances of those classes can be associated with
                entity enclosing requests such as <literal>POST</literal> and <literal>PUT</literal>
                in order to enclose entity content into outgoing HTTP requests. HttpClient provides
                several classes for most common data containers such as string, byte array, input
                stream, and file: <classname>StringEntity</classname>,
                    <classname>ByteArrayEntity</classname>,

                <title>Dynamic content entities</title>
                <para>Often HTTP entities need to be generated dynamically based a particular
                    execution context. HttpClient provides support for dynamic entities by using
                    the <classname>EntityTemplate</classname> entity class and
                        <interfacename>ContentProducer</interfacename> interface. Content producers
                    are objects which produce their content on demand, by writing it out to an
                    output stream. They are expected to be able produce their content every time
                    they are requested to do so. So entities created with
                        <classname>EntityTemplate</classname> are generally self-contained and
                    repeatable.</para>

        <title>HTTP execution context</title>
        <para>Originally HTTP has been designed as a stateless, response-request oriented protocol.
            However, real world applications often need to be able to persist state information
            through several logically related request-response exchanges. In order to enable
            applications to maintain a processing state HttpClient allows HTTP requests to be
            executed within a particular execution context, referred to as HTTP context. Multiple
            logically related requests can participate in a logical session if the same context is
            reused between consecutive requests. HTTP context functions similarly to
            a  <interfacename>java.util.Map&lt;String, Object&gt;</interfacename>. It is
            simply a collection of arbitrary named values. An application can populate context
            attributes prior to request execution or examine the context after the execution has
            been completed.</para>

            socket timeout or an socket reset and <exceptionname>HttpException</exceptionname> that
            signals an HTTP failure such as a violation of the HTTP protocol. Usually I/O errors are
            considered non-fatal and recoverable, whereas HTTP protocol errors are considered fatal
            and cannot be automatically recovered from.</para>

            <title>HTTP transport safety</title>
            <para>It is important to understand that the HTTP protocol is not well suited to all
                types of applications. HTTP is a simple request/response oriented protocol which was
                initially designed to support static or dynamically generated content retrieval. It
                has never been intended to support transactional operations. For instance, the HTTP
                server will consider its part of the contract fulfilled if it succeeds in receiving
                and processing the request, generating a response and sending a status code back to
                the client. The server will make no attempt to roll back the transaction if the
                client fails to receive the response in its entirety due to a read timeout, a
                request cancellation or a system crash. If the client decides to retry the same
                request, the server will inevitably end up executing the same transaction more than
                once. In some cases this may lead to application data corruption or inconsistent
                application state.</para>
            <para>Even though HTTP has never been designed to support transactional processing, it
                can still be used as a transport protocol for mission critical applications provided
                certain conditions are met. To ensure HTTP transport layer safety the system must
                ensure the idempotency of HTTP methods on the application layer.</para>

            </para>
            <para>In other words the application ought to ensure that it is prepared to deal with

        <title>Aborting requests</title>
        <para>In some situations HTTP request execution fails to complete within the expected time

            and unblock the execution thread blocked in a I/O operation. HTTP requests being
            executed by HttpClient can be aborted at any stage of execution by invoking
                <methodname>HttpUriRequest#abort()</methodname> method. This method is thread-safe
            and can be called from any thread. When an HTTP request is aborted its execution thread

        <title>HTTP protocol interceptors</title>
        <para>Th HTTP protocol interceptor is a routine that implements a specific aspect of the HTTP
            protocol. Usually protocol interceptors are expected to act upon one specific header or
            a group of related headers of the incoming message, or populate the outgoing message with
            one specific header or a group of related headers. Protocol interceptors can also
            manipulate content entities enclosed with messages - transparent content compression /
            decompression being a good example. Usually this is accomplished by using the
            'Decorator' pattern where a wrapper entity class is used to decorate the original
            entity. Several protocol interceptors can be combined to form one logical unit.</para>
        <para>Protocol interceptors can collaborate by sharing information - such as a processing
            state - through the HTTP execution context. Protocol interceptors can use HTTP context
            to store a processing state for one request or several consecutive requests.</para>
        <para>Usually the order in which interceptors are executed should not matter as long as they
            do not depend on a particular state of the execution context. If protocol interceptors
            have interdependencies and therefore must be executed in a particular order, they should
            be added to the protocol processor in the same sequence as their expected execution
            order.</para>
        <para>Protocol interceptors must be implemented as thread-safe. Similarly to servlets,
            protocol interceptors should not use instance variables unless access to those variables
            is synchronized.</para>

        <para>The HttpParams interface represents a collection of immutable values that define a runtime
            behavior of a component. In many ways <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> is
            similar to <interfacename>HttpContext</interfacename>. The main distinction between the
            two lies in their use at runtime. Both interfaces represent a collection of objects that
            are organized as a map of keys to object values, but serve distinct purposes:</para>

            <listitem>
                <para><interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> is intended to contain simple
                    objects: integers, doubles, strings, collections and objects that remain
                    immutable at runtime.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> is expected to be used in the 'write
                    once - ready many' mode. <interfacename>HttpContext</interfacename> is intended
                    to contain complex objects that are very likely to mutate in the course of HTTP
                    message processing. </para>

            <listitem>
                <para>The purpose of <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> is to define a
                    behavior of other components. Usually each complex component has its own
                        <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> object. The purpose of
                        <interfacename>HttpContext</interfacename> is to represent an execution
                    state of an HTTP process. Usually the same execution context is shared among
                    many collaborating objects.</para>

            <title>Parameter hierarchies</title>
            <para>In the course of HTTP request execution <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename>
                of the <interfacename>HttpRequest</interfacename> object are linked together with
                    <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> of the
                    <interfacename>HttpClient</interfacename> instance used to execute the request.
                This enables parameters set at the HTTP request level to take precedence over
                    <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> set at the HTTP client level. The
                recommended practice is to set common parameters shared by all HTTP requests at the
                HTTP client level and selectively override specific parameters at the HTTP request
                level.</para>

            <para>The <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> interface allows for a great deal of
                flexibility in handling configuration of components. Most importantly, new
                parameters can be introduced without affecting binary compatibility with older
                versions. However, <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> also has a certain
                disadvantage compared to regular Java beans:
                    <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename> cannot be assembled using a DI
                framework. To mitigate the limitation, HttpClient includes a number of bean classes
                that can used in order to initialize <interfacename>HttpParams</interfacename>
                objects using standard Java bean conventions.</para>

                    <para>activates the <literal>Expect: 100-Continue</literal> handshake for the entity
                        enclosing methods. The purpose of the <literal>Expect:
                            100-Continue</literal> handshake is to allow the client that is sending
                        a request message with a request body to determine if the origin server is
                        willing to accept the request (based on the request headers) before the
                        client sends the request body. The use of the <literal>Expect:
                            100-continue</literal> handshake can result in a noticeable performance
                        improvement for entity enclosing requests (such as <literal>POST</literal>
                        and <literal>PUT</literal>) that require the target server's authentication.
                        The <literal>Expect: 100-continue</literal> handshake should be used with
                        caution, as it may cause problems with HTTP servers and proxies that do not
                        support HTTP/1.1 protocol. This parameter expects a value of type
                            <classname>java.lang.Boolean</classname>. If this parameter is not set,
                        HttpClient will not attempt to use the handshake.</para>
