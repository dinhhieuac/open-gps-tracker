ABOUT
MetaTracker is an application that uses Services and Activities from Open GPS Tracker (OGT) in order to record and
manage tracks for the purpose of GeoSkating (www.geoskating.com). In essence MetaTracker adds the possibility to
add (meta) information to an OGT track on road-quality (essential for skaters) while recording. Annotated tracks can
be uploaded to www.geoskating.com. The road-quality will there be visualized with colors on a digital map.

See more on GeoSkating on www.geoskating.com and on the Google Group GeoSkating:
http://groups.google.com/group/geoskating . As all GeoSkaters are from The Netherlands, the language is Dutch.

For now GeoSkating and its users are the main audience for the MetaTracker but one can envisage other specific
applications that require extra (hence "meta") information to be added easily while recording a track. Think for example of
adding scenery ratings ("green routes"), animal sightings, ... whatever.
